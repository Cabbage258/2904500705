Occasionally, Dad would get out his mandolin and play for the family.
We three children: Trisha, Monte and I, George Jr., would often sing along.
Songs such as the Tennessee Waltz, Harbor Lights and around Christmas time,
the well-known rendition of Silver Bells. "Silver Bells,
Silver Bells, its Christmas time in the city" would ring throughout the house.
One of Dad's favorite hymns was "The Old Rugged Cross".
We learned the words to the hymn when we were very young,
and would sing it with Dad when he would play and sing.
Another song that was often shared in our house was a song that
accompanied the Walt Disney series: Davey Crockett.
Dad only had to hear the song twice before he learned it well enough to play it.
"Davey, Davey Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier" was a favorite song for the family.
